# BPLocate
An android application that downloads Brooklyn Public Library information from NYC open data and displays it in a list

## Features:
* Cahches parsed data to local device
* Update data by hitting the wrench on top
* Search for librarys using the serachbar (Algorithum looks for items containing the query ignoing case)
